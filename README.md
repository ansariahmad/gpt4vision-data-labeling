# **Object Labeling App Readme**

## **Overview:**
This is a Streamlit application designed for labeling objects in images. The application utilizes two primary models: 

1. **Object Detection Model:** This model is responsible for detecting objects within the uploaded image and providing bounding boxes around them.

2. **GPT4-Vision Model:** Leveraging GPT-4's vision capabilities, this model analyzes the bounding boxes generated by the object detection model along with the user-provided labels to predict which labels correspond to objects within those bounding boxes.

## **How to Use the App:**

1. **Setup:**
   - Before using the app, you need to obtain a Personal Authentication Token (PAT) from Clarifai, which will be used for model authentication. Pass this token when prompted.

2. **Upload Image:**
   - Once the setup is complete, upload an image to the application. The object detection model will analyze the image and provide bounding boxes around detected objects.

3. **Labeling:**
   - After the objects are detected, provide different labels related to the objects in the image. These labels will be used by the GPT4-Vision model for further analysis.

4. **Prediction:**
   - The GPT4-Vision model will take the bounding boxes and the labels provided by the user, then predict which label corresponds to each object within the bounding boxes.

## **Key Components:**

- **Streamlit:** The user interface is built using Streamlit, a popular Python library for creating web applications.

- **Object Detection Model:** This model is responsible for identifying objects within the image and drawing bounding boxes around them.

- **GPT4-Vision Model:** This model integrates GPT-4's vision capabilities to understand the context of the objects within the bounding boxes and predict relevant labels based on the user-provided information.

- **Clarifai PAT:** The Personal Authentication Token from Clarifai is necessary for model authentication and usage within the application.

## **Instructions for Running the App:**

1. Install the required dependencies listed in the `requirements.txt` file.
   ```
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

2. Run the Streamlit application script.
   ```
   streamlit run app.py
   ```

3. Follow the on-screen prompts to authenticate with the Clarifai API, upload an image, provide labels, and view the predicted results.

## **Note:**
Ensure that you have appropriate permissions and agreements in place for using the Clarifai API and any other third-party services integrated into the application.
